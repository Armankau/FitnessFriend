# FitnessFriends 

## Project Pitch: 
  FitnessFriend is a fitness app where a user can track their exercise and nutrition in order to achieve their fitness goals!

## Description

FitnessFriends is a fitness app designed to keep track of your daily calories. The app allows you to create an account with a username and password. Then throughout the day the user can add what they’ve eaten and how much calories there was in each meal/food item. The user can also add exercises they’ve done and add the amount of calories each exercise burned. 


## User stories
   * User can log into their account
   * add exercises they’ve done today
   * add what they’ve eaten and specify calorie amount
   * User can review what they’ve eaten and what exercises they’ve done today
   * User can get a brief view of how many calories they’ve burned in previous days
   * User can customize their profile with their weight, profile image, calorie and weight goals
